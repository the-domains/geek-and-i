            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Meet the man behind Stranger Thing's terrifying monster</h1><p>One of the coolest things about Netflix's Stranger Things was the show's antagonist, a horrifying monster that the show's characters took to calling the Demogorgon. As the show has been praised for emulating the works of Spielberg and Carpenter, the actor behind the character has his own inspirations for horrifying audiences.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/69d9192bd540ed578fc8e26f54760b13/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn3.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FmBrajq3wcloHxZBbQL4iihDwXCs%3D%2F0x42%3A800x492%2F1600x900%2Fcdn0.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_image%2Fimage%2F50385893%2FMark_Steger_Still2.0.0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Should Apple Buy Netflix?</h1><p>I was on Leo Laporte's TWIT show yesterday and ended up going on a bit of a rant about Apple and "Planet of the Apps." My view on "content" efforts like this is pretty simple. It is distracting, non-core to Apple and basically avoids the bigger challenges: how to add data and Internet DNA into a company that has managed to struggle with services.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6b5753afc4e6bcdfbae08643ff9e191c/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fom.co%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2FNetflixOffice.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Can 42 US, a free coding school run by a French billionaire, actually work?</h1><p>FREMONT, Calif.-As you read these words, hundreds of students are hunched over iMacs in a massive computer lab. Most of them have little, if any, programming experience, and they haven't paid a cent to get here. And yet, here they sit, just 7.6 miles directly across the Dumbarton Bridge from Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, dreaming of joining Silicon Valley's legions of programmers.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/23b799903913bc5197bc3c95b7218b85/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.arstechnica.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2FIMG_6321-640x427.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Data rates and latencies are everything, with data centers and chips designed to maximize communication speeds. The hero in the world of data is the optical fiber. Thanks to light's very high base frequency, it is possible to modulate it very quickly without using a huge amount of bandwidth.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1428a53e1b297d2ae7ff30bfc74df8f6/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.arstechnica.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2FARC-16211-1-Optical-Fiber-for-Solar-Cells1-640x484.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Linux bug leaves USA Today, other top sites vulnerable to serious hijacking attacks</h1><p>Computer scientists have discovered a serious Internet vulnerability that allows attackers to terminate connections between virtually any two parties and, if the connections aren't encrypted, inject malicious code or content into the parties' communications. The vulnerability resides in the design and implementation of RFC 5961, a relatively new Internet standard that's intended to prevent certain classes of hacking attacks.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a4d4464b9dedd5c2371ecab1e56ec614/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.arstechnica.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2Foff-path-attack-640x369.jpg"></article>]]></description>
