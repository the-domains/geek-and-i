            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Tiny rocket company aims for 100 launches a year-and it just might succeed</h1><p>Alone in the Mojave desert, the tiny rocket stood barely as tall as a basketball goal backboard. Launch control was a laptop inside a nearby bunker, and the small gathering of aerospace engineers and investors seemed almost like a rocket hobby club as they watched the vehicle soar to about 5,000 feet before parachuting back to Earth.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e18403ddd97bb7ca9d2a3e244aa225b3/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.arstechnica.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2F13680965_269472006757075_5300719751498717914_n-640x480.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is Elon Musk serious about the Tesla Semi?</h1><p>Out of all of Elon Musk's recent "Master Plan Part Deux," the part that really caught our eye was a short paragraph about a Tesla semi. Much of the rest-solar, autonomous driving, ride-sharing-wasn't exactly unforeseen. But the idea of a heavy duty Tesla electric vehicle took us by surprise and left us scratching our heads.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5e9b2daad5809a0bdefbf8b368f7debe/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.arstechnica.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2FWS_Mack-LR-640x480.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>There are limits to 2FA and it can be near-crippling to your digital life</h1><p>This piece first appeared on Medium and is republished here with the permission of the author. It reveals a limitation in the way Apple approaches 2FA, which is most likely a deliberate decision. Apple engineers probably recognize that someone who loses their phone won't be able to wipe data if 2FA is enforced, and this story is a good reminder of the pitfalls.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ea01424d02b41b7d8df2aa393a37a5c2/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.arstechnica.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F07%2Fphonecloseup-980x653.jpg"></article>]]></description>
