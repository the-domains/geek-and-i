  FREMONT, Calif.-As you read these words, hundreds of students are hunched over
  iMacs in a massive computer lab. Most of them have little, if any, programming
  experience, and they haven't paid a cent to get here. And yet, here they sit,
  just 7.6 miles directly across the Dumbarton Bridge from Facebook headquarters
  in Menlo Park, dreaming of joining Silicon Valley's legions of programmers.
