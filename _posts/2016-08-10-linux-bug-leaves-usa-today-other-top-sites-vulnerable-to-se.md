  Computer scientists have discovered a serious Internet vulnerability that
  allows attackers to terminate connections between virtually any two parties
  and, if the connections aren't encrypted, inject malicious code or content
  into the parties' communications. The vulnerability resides in the design and
  implementation of RFC 5961, a relatively new Internet standard that's intended
  to prevent certain classes of hacking attacks.
