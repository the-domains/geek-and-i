  We live and die by data these days. Data rates and latencies are everything,
  with data centers and chips designed to maximize communication speeds. The
  hero in the world of data is the optical fiber. Thanks to light's very high
  base frequency, it is possible to modulate it very quickly without using a
  huge amount of bandwidth.
