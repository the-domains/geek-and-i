  On Saturday, someone started leaking the NSA's secrets. A pop-up Twitter
  account called "theshadowbrokers" posted a link to a pastebin, which in turn
  led to more than 300 MB of exploits and scripts. According to the Shadow
  Brokers, the data came from the Equation Group, an advanced malware threat
  long linked to the NSA.
