  This piece first appeared on Medium and is republished here with the
  permission of the author. It reveals a limitation in the way Apple approaches
  2FA, which is most likely a deliberate decision. Apple engineers probably
  recognize that someone who loses their phone won't be able to wipe data if 2FA
  is enforced, and this story is a good reminder of the pitfalls.
