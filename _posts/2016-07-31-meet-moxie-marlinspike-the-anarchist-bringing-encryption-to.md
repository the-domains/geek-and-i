  On the first day of the sprawling RSA security industry conference in San

  National Security Agency director Michael Rogers in a crisp military uniform;
  bearded and besuited Whitfield Diffie and Ron Rivest, legendary inventors of
  seminal encryption protocols that made the Internet safe for communication and
  commerce.
