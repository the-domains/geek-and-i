  A Dallas, Texas man accused of prostituting underage girls was secretly
  ordered by a federal judge to unlock his iPhone using his fingerprint,
  according to federal court documents that are now unsealed. It's rare that we
  see a case demanding that a phone be unlocked in that manner, but we should
  expect more as the mainstream public begins embracing fingerprint technology.
