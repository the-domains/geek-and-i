  One of the coolest things about Netflix's Stranger Things was the show's
  antagonist, a horrifying monster that the show's characters took to calling
  the Demogorgon. As the show has been praised for emulating the works of
  Spielberg and Carpenter, the actor behind the character has his own
  inspirations for horrifying audiences.
