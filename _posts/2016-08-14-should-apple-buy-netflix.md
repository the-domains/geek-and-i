  I was on Leo Laporte's TWIT show yesterday and ended up going on a bit of a
  rant about Apple and "Planet of the Apps." My view on "content" efforts like
  this is pretty simple. It is distracting, non-core to Apple and basically
  avoids the bigger challenges: how to add data and Internet DNA into a company
  that has managed to struggle with services.
