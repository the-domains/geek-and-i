      Tesla's road to a cheaper electric car has always appeared to lead
      straight to Reno, where the electric automaker is building a $5 billion
      gigafactory designed with enough capacity to reduce the per-kilowatt-hour
      cost of its lithium-ion battery packs by over 30% by the end of 2017.

  Out of all of Elon Musk's recent "Master Plan Part Deux," the part that really
  caught our eye was a short paragraph about a Tesla semi. Much of the
  rest-solar, autonomous driving, ride-sharing-wasn't exactly unforeseen. But
  the idea of a heavy duty Tesla electric vehicle took us by surprise and left
  us scratching our heads.
