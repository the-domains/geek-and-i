  Verizon Wireless recently unveiled some new postpaid data plans with features
  popularized by T-Mobile USA, including rollover data and unlimited data that
  lets customers stay connected at slower speeds after using up their high-speed
  allotments. Verizon today announced similar changes to its prepaid offerings
  with "Always-On Data" that throttles speeds to 128kbps after customers have
  used up all their high-speed data.
