  Security experts have discovered a malware platform that's so advanced in its
  design and execution that it could probably have been developed only with the
  active support of a nation state. The malware-known alternatively as
  "ProjectSauron" by researchers from Kaspersky Lab and "Remsec" by their
  counterparts from Symantec-has been active since at least 2011 and has been
  discovered on 30 or so targets.
