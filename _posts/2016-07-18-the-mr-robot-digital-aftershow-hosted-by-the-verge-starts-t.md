  We're very pleased to announce that we'll be hosting the official Mr. Robot
  Digital Aftershow every week, in partnership with USA Network. Every week
  after the show, Emily Yoshida, Russell Brandom, and I will be breaking down
  the episode, looking at the tech and hacks involved, talking to guests from
  the cast and crew, and taking questions and feedback from fans on Twitter and
  (of course) our very own Mr. Robot IRC channel.
